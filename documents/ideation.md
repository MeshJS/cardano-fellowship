# Cardano Fellowship (WIP)
Initial doc to ideate on the Cardano Technical Fellowship

### Problem Statement
The Cardano Ecosystem grew and evolved a lot and has cultivated an amazing community, full of Talents. While many talents found their way into a full-time position at Projects/Entities working on Cardano, there is still a solid number of individual contributors which have proven their talent and committment over years, and yet did not find a place which ensures full-time positions. For now, our ecosystem seems abnle in cultivating talents and yet, lack the abilities to later also retain such talents.

### Solution
The establishment of a Cardano Technical Fellowship, a fully independent onchain-collective of cardano developers with full-time position, secured and funded by the Cardano Treasury. 
Nothing too crazy actually since such concepts are already implemented in otherWeb3 ecosystems, e.g see [The Polkadot Technical Fellowship](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship/) from which we can draw easily and adapt/adopt to Cardano

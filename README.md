# cardano-fellowship
Public repo to explore &amp; establish a Cardano Fellowship.

Open to contribute for anyone who is willing to put the time and efforts in. Everything in earliest brainstorm phase right now, open to any kind of ideas & suggestions whcih help to move the concept forward.

## TODO
1) Ideation:

- Very much RnD, lets do some research on solutions which may already exist instead of re-inventing the wheel. Identify what worked, didnt worked, take the good, leave the bad and draft a initial document of the Cardano Technical Fellowship. Also define next steps and whatever may follow the ideation.

Ideation doc at: https://github.com/MeshJS/cardano-fellowship/blob/main/documents/ideation.md

Discussions at: https://github.com/MeshJS/cardano-fellowship/discussions/1

 ## Potential rough roadmap:
   - create concept doc
     > document which outlines the technical fellowship at all its layers, ideally shared in public, get feedback, build awareness
   - create CIP (not sure if needed)
     > CIP to implement technical requirements if needed
   - create info action (temp chech)
     > info action to present the Fellowship to gov bodies (DRep/CC/SPO) and get temp check, if approved, then enables ->
   - create Gov_action to implement (e.g protocol_parameter_changes)
     > implement technical requirements to the protocol (fellowship sub-treasury, governance mechanics, etc)
   - create Gov_action to activate (treasury_withdrawal) 
     > enable the funding for the fellowhsip from the Cardano Treasury
